	<h1> Jo Journey through www & @theworld </h1>
	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p>My name is Ioana and I am from Romania. My foreigner friends have difficulties pronouncing my name. I have been called Joanna, Iana, Nana and I can go on and on. One stuck with me though. It was Jo , from Joanna hence the Jo name in the site title. I found it short, sweet and easy to pronounce and remember. </p>

	<p>Recently, I started a web developer bootcamp , more precisely zerotomastery academy and this is my first website. Since I am in love with everything vintage , analog and back to the 80s look ..this page will not have a lot of design but it will have I hope lots of JavaScript. 
	It is my learning journey through web development and coding. </p>
